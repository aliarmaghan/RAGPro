    "**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** is a technique used in information retrieval to combine the results of multiple ranking systems (e.g., different search algorithms or retrieval models) into a single, improved ranking. It is particularly useful in **hybrid search systems**, where you want to leverage the strengths of multiple retrieval methods (e.g., semantic search and syntactic search) to produce better results.\n",

    "### **How Reciprocal Rank Fusion Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "RRF assigns a score to each document based on its rank in multiple ranked lists (e.g., from different retrieval models). The key idea is that documents appearing in the top ranks of multiple lists should be ranked higher in the final combined list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for RRF is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{RRF Score}(d) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k + \\text{rank}_i(d)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( d \\): A document.\n",
    "- \\( n \\): The number of ranked lists being combined.\n",
    "- \\( \\text{rank}_i(d) \\): The rank of document \\( d \\) in the \\( i \\)-th ranked list.\n",
    "- \\( k \\): A constant (typically \\( k = 60 \\)) that controls the influence of lower-ranked documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final ranking is determined by sorting documents based on their RRF scores in descending order.\n",

    "### **Why Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion?**\n",
    "1. **Combines Strengths of Multiple Models**: RRF allows you to combine results from different retrieval models (e.g., dense retrieval for semantic search and BM25 for syntactic search) to improve overall retrieval quality.\n",
    "2. **Handles Disagreements Between Models**: If one model ranks a document highly but another ranks it low, RRF balances these disagreements by considering the reciprocal of the ranks.\n",
    "3. **Simple and Effective**: RRF is computationally efficient and does not require training or additional parameters.\n",
